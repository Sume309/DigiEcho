# Order Management JavaScript Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The order-management.php page was showing jQuery errors:
- `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'then')` at line 641
- `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'then')`

## Root Cause
The code was trying to call `.then()` method on DataTables methods that don't return Promises. DataTables' `ajax.reload()` method doesn't return a Promise, but the code was treating it as if it did.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Promise Usage in order-management.php
- Removed `.then()` calls on DataTables methods
- Updated `refreshOrdersTable()` function to not return a Promise
- Fixed `$(document).ready()` function initialization
- Updated auto-refresh interval callback
- Fixed refresh button click handler
- Simplified `updateOrderStatus()` function

### 2. Added Missing Dependencies
- Added SweetAlert2 CDN link for proper alert functionality
- Added fallback handling in `showAlert()` function

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Added proper includes for settings.php
- Added fallback for autoload.php in case it fails
- Updated both main file and AJAX file

### 4. Created Test File
- Created test-order-management-fix.html for validation

## Files Modified
- `admin/order-management.php` - Main fixes
- `admin/order-management-ajax.php` - Added proper includes
- `admin/test-order-management-fix.html` - New test file

## How to Test
1. Open http://localhost/php%20project/Family-Haat-Bazar/admin/order-management.php
2. Check browser console - should see no JavaScript errors
3. Test DataTable functionality (filtering, pagination, etc.)
4. Test SweetAlert notifications

## Key Technical Changes
- Removed Promise chains from DataTables operations
- Used callback functions instead of Promise `.then()`
- Added proper error handling and fallbacks
- Ensured all required libraries are loaded

The page should now load without JavaScript errors and all functionality should work properly.
