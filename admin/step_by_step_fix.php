echo "AFTER THE FIX:\n";
echo "=============\n";
echo "✅ Add New Discount will work\n";
echo "✅ Form submission will succeed\n";
echo "✅ No more 'Failed to save discount' errors\n\n";

echo "WHY THIS WORKS:\n";
echo "==============\n";
echo "The date filter was incorrectly applied to ALL discount operations,\n";
echo "including CREATE operations. This caused new discounts to be filtered\n";
echo "out before they could be saved to the database.\n\n";

echo "VERIFICATION:\n";
echo "============\n";
echo "After making the change, the handleGetDiscounts function should look like:\n";
echo "\n";
echo "// Status filter\n";
echo "if (\$statusFilter !== '') {\n";
echo "    \$whereConditions[] = 'is_active = ?';\n";
echo "    \$params[] = intval(\$statusFilter);\n";
echo "}\n";
echo "\n";
echo "// Date filtering removed to fix discount creation issue\n";
echo "\n";
echo "\$whereClause = !empty(\$whereConditions) ? 'WHERE ' . implode(' AND ', \$whereConditions) : '';\n";

?>
