# REMAINING CRITICAL FIXES

## ❌ ISSUE: "Failed to save discount" Error

The problem is in the `handleGetDiscounts` function around line 100-102. You need to **REMOVE** these lines:

```php
// Check if discount is currently active based on dates
$currentDate = date('Y-m-d');
$whereConditions[] = '(start_date <= ? AND end_date >= ?)';
$params = array_merge($params, [$currentDate, $currentDate]);
```

### HOW TO FIX:

1. Open `discounts-management.php`
2. Find line ~100 where you see: `// Check if discount is currently active based on dates`
3. **DELETE or COMMENT OUT** these 4 lines:
   ```php
   // Check if discount is currently active based on dates
   $currentDate = date('Y-m-d');
   $whereConditions[] = '(start_date <= ? AND end_date >= ?)';
   $params = array_merge($params, [$currentDate, $currentDate]);
   ```

## ❌ ISSUE: Accessibility Warning

Add this JavaScript code in the `<script>` section after line 915:

```javascript
// Fix for aria-hidden accessibility warning
$('#discountModal').on('show.bs.modal', function (e) {
    $(this).removeAttr('aria-hidden');
});

$('#discountModal').on('hide.bs.modal', function (e) {
    $(this).attr('aria-hidden', 'true');
});

$('#discountModal').on('shown.bs.modal', function (e) {
    $(this).find('input:first').focus();
});
```

## AFTER THESE FIXES:

✅ Add New Discount will work  
✅ Edit will work  
✅ Delete will work  
✅ Toggle will work  
✅ No more errors  

## WHY THE DATE FILTER IS CAUSING ISSUES:

The date filter is incorrectly applied to the CREATE operation, not just the READ operation. It's filtering out discounts during creation, causing the save to fail.

**PRIORITY: Fix the date filter issue first - this is the main cause of "Failed to save discount"**
