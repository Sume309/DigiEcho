# Error Fix Summary - PHP Warning Resolution

## Issue Description
User reported a PHP warning when accessing category URLs:
```
Warning: Trying to access array offset on value of type null in D:\xampp\htdocs\Family-Haat-Bazar\index.php on line 146
URL: http://localhost/Family-Haat-Bazar/index.php?category=26
```

## Root Cause
The error occurred when accessing non-existent category/subcategory IDs. The code was trying to access array properties (like `$category['name']`) on null values returned from database queries when no matching records were found.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added comprehensive null checks before accessing array properties
- Implemented `$hasError` flag to control content display
- Added user-friendly error pages with professional styling

### 2. JavaScript Safety Measures
- Added `!$hasError` condition to JavaScript variable initialization
- Wrapped entire JavaScript block in conditional PHP to prevent execution during error states
- This prevents JavaScript errors when PHP variables are null

### 3. Database Query Validation
The existing error handling logic was enhanced:
```php
if ($category) {
    $filterTitle = htmlspecialchars($category['name']) . ' Products';
    $filterSubtitle = 'Browse all products in this category';
} else {
    // Category not found
    $hasError = true;
    $errorMessage = 'Category not found';
    $filterTitle = 'Category Not Found';
}
```

### 4. Conditional Content Display
- Error pages show user-friendly messages with navigation back to home
- JavaScript only loads when `!$hasError` to prevent runtime errors
- Product loading is skipped during error conditions

## Files Modified
- `index.php` - Enhanced error handling and conditional JavaScript loading

## Error Prevention
- All array access now includes null checks
- Error states properly handled with user-friendly messages
- JavaScript execution prevented during PHP error conditions
- Professional error page styling with navigation options

## Result
- No more PHP warnings when accessing invalid category/subcategory URLs
- Users see professional error pages instead of PHP warnings
- System gracefully handles all edge cases with proper error recovery
